# CurrencyExchange
my first currency exchange code repo with test scripts 
Here I understand the fundamentals of Solidity by applying the EIC - 20 standards of Tokens 
I create a Token called 'Bharat' with 1000000 in circulation which can be transfered by the msg.sender or can be transfered on the sender's behalf
Apart from that I can check balances, emit each transfer event that happens consisting of from & To address and the respective token value
